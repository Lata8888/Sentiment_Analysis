# Sentiment_Analysis (Natural Language Processing)
 This project focuses on sentiment analysis, categorizing text into positive or negative or neutral sentiments using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. The preprocessing pipeline includes lemmatization, stopword removal, and feature extraction using the TF-IDF vectorizer. The spaCy library is utilized for text processing. For classification, a Random Forest Classifier is employed to achieve robust and accurate sentiment predictions. The project aims to enhance sentiment classification by leveraging effective preprocessing techniques.
